	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

          XMEDIA SFC supports BP(Block Protect) feature to preestablish a series
          area to avoid writing and erasing, except to reading. With this macro
          definition we can get the BP info which was setted before. The
          BOTTOM/TOP bit is setted to BOTTOM, it means the lock area starts
          from 0 address.
