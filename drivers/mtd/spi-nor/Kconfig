	  This enables access to SPI NOR flash, using MT81xx SPI NOR flash
	  controller. This controller does not support generic SPI BUS, it only
	  supports SPI NOR Flash.

config MTD_SPI_NOR_USE_4K_SECTORS
	bool "Use small 4096 B erase sectors"
	default y
	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

	  This driver does not support generic SPI. The implementation only
	  supports SPI NOR.

config SPI_CADENCE_QUADSPI

	depends on OF && ARM
	help
	  Enable support for the Cadence Quad SPI Flash controller.

	  Cadence QSPI is a specialized controller for connecting an SPI
	  Flash over 1/2/4-bit wide bus. Enable this option if you have a
	  device with a Cadence QSPI controller and want to access the
	  Flash as an MTD device.

	  XMEDIA SFC supports BP(Block Protect) feature to preestablish a series
	  area to avoid writing and erasing, except to reading. With this macro
	  definition we can get the BP info which was setted before. The
	  BOTTOM/TOP bit is setted to BOTTOM, it means the lock area starts
	  from 0 address.

	  SPIFI is a specialized controller for connecting serial SPI
	  Flash. Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFI
	  controller and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.
