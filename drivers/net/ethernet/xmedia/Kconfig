	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Xmedia devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

	  This selects the Xmedia Fast Ethernet MAC device(FEMAC).
	  The FEMAC receives and transmits data over Ethernet
	  ports at 10/100 Mbps in full-duplex or half-duplex mode.
	  The FEMAC exchanges data with the CPU, and supports
	  the energy efficient Ethernet (EEE).
